11. An outlier is any value of a feature that lies abnormally far from the rest of the data in the same feature.
    IQR or inter quartile range is the difference between 3rd Quartile and the 1st.
		IQR=Q3-Q1
    This IQR is then multiplied by 1.5(a constant)
		IQR x 1.5
    Then subtract this from first quartile and add it to third quartile
		Q1-(1.5 x IQR) and Q3+(1.5 x IQR)
    Any number that does not fall within this range is considered an outlier.

12. Bagging is a technique to reduce the variance of the data by providing additional data
    for training using repetitive combinations whereas boosting is a technique which adjusts 
    the weight of an observation.

13. Adjusted R2 score gives the percentage of variation explained by the independent
    variable that affect the dependent variable.

14. Normalisation is the process by which a feature is scaled so as to have all the data points
    in the range of 0 to 1, while Standardisation is the process by which the feature /variable
    is transformed to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

15. Cross validation is a technique in which the data is fed to the model for training 
    in the form of multiple subsets. The entire data set is used for training and testing
    in consecutive steps. 
    Advantages 		- Reduces overfitting, Hyper parameter tuning

    Disadvantages 	- Increases training time, chances to misses some observations and
			  select some more than once.
