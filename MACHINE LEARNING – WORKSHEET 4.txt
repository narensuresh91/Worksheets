MACHINE LEARNING – WORKSHEET 4

Q1. A) GridSearchCV()
Q2. A) Random forest
Q3. B) The regularization will decrease
Q4. A) It regularizes the decision tree by limiting the maximum depth up to which a tree can be grown.
Q5. A) It's an ensemble of weak learners.
Q6. A) Gradient Descent algorithm can diverge from the optimal solution.
Q7. B) Bias will decrease, Variance increase
Q8. A) model is underfitting

Q9. Gini index is obtained by the formula 1- S(p^2)
    Here the probabilities are 0.4 and 0.6 respectively.
    Thus Gini index = 1 - ((0.4*0.4) + (0.6*0.6))
		    = 1-(0.16+0.36)
		    = 0.48
    
    Entropy of the dataset is calculated by the fomula P1log2P1 + P2log2P2
    Entropy = 0.4log2(0.4)+0.6log2(0.6)
	    = 0.4*(-1.32)+ 0.6*(-0.73)
	    = -0.92 + -0.13
	    = - 1.05

Q10. Advantages of random forest over decision tree are :
	i) Random Forest reduces overfitting and is more accurate.
	ii)Random forest supports bagging and bootstrapping algorithms
	iii)Random forest can create a model with a much lower variance by using multiple trees.

Q11. Feature scaling is necessary so as to avoid the machine giving additional weights to higher values and will create a model that is not accurate.
The most common techniques used for scaling are Normalization and Standardization.

Q12. i)Scaling increases the speed of gradient descent
     ii) If we don’t scale the data, the level curves (contours) would be narrower and taller

Q13. No, accuracy is not a good metric for the an imbalanced data classification problem. Accuracy will be high as the dataset is imbalanced and the machine 
predictions would be in such a way that all the inputs would be directly predicted to the most occuring outcome. Hence more metrics like confustion matrix, f1 score, recall and precision are to be considered.

Q14. F1- Score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall which takes into consideration the true positive rate and the true negative rates.
	F1- score has a highest possible value of 1, is calculated by :

	F1 = 2x(precisionxrecall)/(precision+recall)

Q15. Fit() calculates the values ( mean and standard deviation) of the parameters.
     Transform() applies the values of the parameters on the actual data and returns the normalized value
     fit_transform performs both the actions fit and transform in the same step.
