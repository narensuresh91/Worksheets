MACHINE LEARNING – WORKSHEET 6

Q1. A) Yes
Q2. A) Red
Q3. A) They allow misclassifications, that’s why they are not optimal
    B) They cannot be used when the data is not completely linearly separable while allowing no errors
    &  C) They are not optimal to use in case of outliers
Q4. A) It is the most optimal classifier in a completely linearly separable data.
Q5. B) No
Q6. D) They can be used in case data is not completely linearly separable
Q7. A) They take the data from lower dimensional space to some higher dimensional space in case the data is not
likely to be linearly separable
Q8. A) These functions gives value of the dot product of pairs of data-points in the desired higher dimensional
space without even explicitly converting the whole data in to higher dimensional space
Q9. D) It is a model trained using supervised learning. It can be used for classification not for regression.
Q10. D) All of the above
