Q10. Bayes' theorem states that if A and B denote two events, P(A|B) denotes the conditional probability of A occurring, given that B occurs.

Q11. A z-score indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. A z-score can be calculated from the following formula.

	z = (X - µ) / s

Q12.  t-test is a type of inferential statistic used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.A t-test is used as a hypothesis testing tool, which allows testing of an assumption applicable to a population. 

Q13. Percentile can be explained as the percentage of values falling below the specific percentile.

Q14. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of two or more independent groups.

Q15. It provides the overall test of equality for group means, it can control the type 1 error rate.
