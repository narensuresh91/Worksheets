Q4. d) All of the mentioned
Q5. c) Poisson
Q6. 
Q7. b) Hypothesis
Q8. a) 0
Q9. b) Outliers can be the result of spurious or real processes

Q10. Normal distribution is any distribution which has a mean of 0 and has a standard deviation of 1. It is represented by a bell shaped curve symmetric at the y axis.

Q11. Missing data if very less in percentage can be removed from the dataset. If otherwise, imputation techniques are to be used as:
	Categorical data - use the most frequent occurance to fill the data
Numerical - Mean substitution, hot-deck, cold-deck can be used.

Q12. A/B testing is a randomized experiment with two variants A and B.Hypothesis test is then done to find which of the variant is more effective.

Q13. Yes, it is acceptable to an extend if the number of missing values are not a big chunk of the dataset. Also needs to be considered if majority of data is within the region of the mean.

Q14. LR is a linear approach modelling the relationship between a dependent variable and the independent variables.

Q15. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics
	Descriptive - The branch of statistics that focuses on collecting, summarizing, and presenting a set of data.
	Inferential - The branch of statistics that analyzes sample data to draw conclusions about a population.
